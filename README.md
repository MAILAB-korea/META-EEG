# META-EEG
The official implementations of "META-EEG: Meta-learning-based Class-relevant EEG Representation Learning for Zero-calibration Brain-computer Interfaces". <br>
Our implementations are based on [higher](https://github.com/facebookresearch/higher).

# Training
- Our code can be executed after modyfing the parameter values in "train.yaml" using the following command: <br>
```bash
python main.py --config=./train.yaml
```
